*The predicted result along with accuracies is displayed in the above image. The best model is highlighted.*

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
        git clone https://github.com/gannemjahnavi/HAND_DIGIT_RECOGNITION.git
   
    

3. Install dependencies:
        pip install -r requirements.txt
    

4. Run the application:
        python app.py
    

## Usage

1. Open the UI by navigating to http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.
2. Click on the "Browse" button to upload a handwritten digit image.
3. Once uploaded, view the predicted results displayed on the UI.

## Conclusion

Based on the results obtained, it can be concluded that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) outperform the other algorithms for handwritten digit recognition.
